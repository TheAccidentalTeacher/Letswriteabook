- `GET /api/novels/quality-metrics/:jobId` - Quality scoring
- `GET /api/novels/cost-tracking/:jobId` - Cost analysis
- `GET /api/novels/monitoring/:jobId` - Complete monitoring data

**Enhanced WebSocket System:**
- 9 real-time event types for comprehensive monitoring
- Live story bible updates during generation
- Real-time continuity checking and alerts
- Progressive quality metric updates
- Live cost tracking and token usage
- Enhancement application notifications
- AI decision transparency stream

**Functional Continuity Guardian:**
- Pattern-based character extraction
- Plot thread identification
- Timeline event tracking
- Real-time consistency validation
- Automated alert generation

## üåê DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Railway Backend Deployment
```bash
# Current branch: monitoring-transparency-system
# Push to Railway (will auto-deploy)
git push origin monitoring-transparency-system

# Set Railway environment variables:
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=3
COST_ALERT_THRESHOLD=25.00
ENABLE_COST_TRACKING=true
ENABLE_QUALITY_METRICS=true
```

### 2. Frontend Integration
```bash
# Frontend is already configured for the new monitoring routes
# Ensure VITE_API_BASE_URL points to Railway backend
# New route: /monitor/:jobId for the monitoring dashboard
```

### 3. Database Migration
**No migration needed** - the enhanced metadata structure is backward compatible.
Existing jobs will have empty metadata that gets populated during new generation.
