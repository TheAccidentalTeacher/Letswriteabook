HUMAN-LIKE WRITING REQUIREMENTS:
- Plan for internal conflicts between main characters that won't resolve easily
- Identify opportunities for characters to fail meaningfully without plot advancement
- Consider morally ambiguous situations with no clear right answers
- Plan distinctive speech patterns and verbal tics for each major character
- Include mundane, lived-in world details that don't advance plot
- Design at least 2-3 unresolved elements to leave open
- Ensure antagonist has understandable (if wrong) motivations
- Plan for interpersonal friction based on fundamental value differences
- Create backstories with contradictory elements that surprise readers",

HUMAN-LIKE CHAPTER WRITING REQUIREMENTS:

CHARACTER AUTHENTICITY:
- Each character should have distinctive speech patterns, verbal tics, and vocabulary choices
- Include subtext in dialogue - characters saying one thing but meaning another
- Show characters making unexpected but believable choices that reveal contradictions
- Avoid repetitive character descriptions (same traits mentioned repeatedly)
- Include genuine interpersonal friction that doesn't resolve easily
- Show characters failing meaningfully without immediate plot advancement

NARRATIVE REALISM:
- Add mundane frustrations: equipment breaking, miscommunications, physical discomfort
- Include sensory inconsistencies - characters perceiving same events differently
- Avoid over-explaining themes or having characters speak too philosophically
- Let conflicts be messy and not resolve too neatly or conveniently
- Show genuine surprise for protagonists - they should be caught off-guard
- Avoid too many profound or scripted-sounding conversations

WORLD DEPTH:
- Reference specific in-world cultural elements (songs, sayings, shared history)
- Include organic humor that emerges naturally from situations
- Add small equipment failures or everyday complications at inconvenient times
- Show characters dealing with mundane annoyances that compound
- Vary sensory details - different smells, tastes, textures, sounds

STRUCTURAL VARIETY:
- Avoid formulaic chapter structure (setup-conflict-resolution)
- Vary prose style based on which character is the focus
- Include unexpected moments that don't serve the main plot
- End with something unresolved or complicating rather than neat closure
- Break expected narrative patterns with genuine surprises
- Mix chapter formats - some action-heavy, others reflective, some through logs/messages

ANTAGONIST COMPLEXITY:
- Make antagonists more complex with understandable motivations beyond simple greed
- Show opposition that makes valid points even when wrong overall
- Create conflicts where there's no clear "right" answer
- Develop institutional/corporate enemies with human faces and relatable reasons",

- Plan for different characters to perceive same events differently
- Include at least one chapter focused on mundane frustrations and complications
