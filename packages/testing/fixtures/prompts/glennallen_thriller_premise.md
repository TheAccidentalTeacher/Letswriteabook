# Copper Sky: Glennallen Post-Apocalyptic Thriller Premise

## Working title

Copper Sky

## High-concept premise

In the Copper River Valley, the junction town of Glennallen survives the first wave of an alien war that has flattened Anchorage and military bases across Alaska. While alien scouts haven’t reached the junction yet, the town sits on critical crossroads and infrastructure—the Glenn and Richardson Highways, access to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline corridor, and the gateway to Wrangell–St. Elias. While locals pull together with bush pilots, linemen, medics, and Ahtna leaders to harden their community for a siege, a strike team of mech-armored humans arrives—from the future.

They claim Glenallen must become the fulcrum of a counter-history: hold the junction, keep the pipeline corridor in play, and set a trap that will stop the invasion before it metastasizes. But time travel has rules. The future team won’t tell everything, can’t intervene everywhere, and their presence draws attention. When the aliens finally pivot inland, Glennallen becomes both refuge and target—and the battle at the junction will determine whether Alaska’s interior remains free long enough to turn the tide.

Themes: frontier resilience and community sovereignty, the ethics of changing history, “cold country” survival in a subarctic climate, and the cost of choosing between stealth and power.

## Setting: Glennallen and the Copper River Valley

- The town: A small census-designated place, population under 500, Glennallen sits where the Glenn Highway (AK-1) meets the Richardson Highway (AK-4/2), about 189 road miles east of Anchorage. It’s the supply and services hub of the Copper River region and sits just west of Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve. Mount Drum and the massif of the Wrangells dominate the southern skyline on clear days.
- Geography and climate: Dry-summer subarctic climate. Long, brutal winters with extended sub-zero temperatures, short summers, thick mosquitoes, and vast daylight swings. Freeze-up changes how and where people travel; thaw undermines culverts and permafrost. The taiga is laced with black spruce and muskeg that can swallow any vehicle that strays off-road.
- Rivers and access: The Copper River system runs south to the Gulf; the Gulkana River (a designated Wild and Scenic tributary) passes close by, with popular campgrounds and a bridge on the Richardson. The McCarthy and Nabesna roads lead deeper into Wrangell–St. Elias country, with Chitina acting as a gateway for river and park access.
- Roads that matter: The Glenn (from Anchorage), the Richardson (north to Delta Junction/Fairbanks, south to Valdez), and the Tok Cut-Off (east toward the Alaska Highway and Canada). The Richardson roughly parallels the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (TAPS) for long stretches. In crisis, the junction is a valve for people and resources.
- Infrastructure and services: Engineered for sparse populations. Electricity from regional cooperatives (CVEA covers Glennallen and Valdez) with generation and substations spread across vast distances. Many homes rely on well water or trucked deliveries; parts of town have piped sewage, but permafrost and high water tables can complicate drain fields. Healthcare is via clinics like Cross Road Medical Center and the Copper River Native Association. Law enforcement via Alaska State Troopers. Local radio is a lifeline.
- Aviation: The Gulkana Airport sits a few miles northeast and is critical for mail, medevac, and supplies; there’s also a small turf strip (Brenwick’s) for local access. In a war, these fields become strategic prizes.

The town’s psyche is formed by self-reliance, the memory of highway building and pipeline booms, and the nearby Ahtna communities whose deep relationship to the Copper River predates colonial roads by millennia.

## Principal cast

Primary human protagonists (locals)

- Lena Tagyai (early 30s): Ahtna EMT at Cross Road Medical Center and seasonal river guide on the Gulkana. Practical, stubborn, intimately familiar with backcountry routes, fishing seasons, and ice. Self-appointed coordinator of a volunteer response network that grew from fishing and search-and-rescue lists. She keeps it real: food, heat, medicine, elders first. Her moral compass: no one gets left.
- Cole Anders (mid-40s): Copper Valley Electric lineman and former Army engineer. The guy who can stand on a bucket truck at –30°F to keep the lights on, and who knows where every transformer, substation, and spare spool lives. Haunted by a winter rollover that killed his apprentice years ago; meticulous about safety, even now.
- Ava “Skiff” Vandegrift (late 20s): Bush pilot, owner of a battered Cessna. Adrenaline junkie with impeccable weather sense, a knack for finding a ceiling when none exists, and a hidden streak of faith tied to the land. Capable of dead-reckoning to a gravel bar by smell and sound.
- Sgt. Nate Hollis (late 30s): Alaska State Trooper. Calm, laconic, four steps ahead of any drunk with a rifle and five steps behind the weather. Wrecked cruiser, salvaged shotgun, still believes in the rule of law even when radios go dead. Excellent tracker, steady hand under stress.
- Elder Marie K’elt’a (70s): Ahtna matriarch from a village near Gakona. Keeper of stories and of the relationships that actually move people: who can call whose cousin for fuel, who can ask for salmon from the wheel, who can speak for the river. When she speaks, voices drop and plans cohere.

Mech-armored future protagonists (the “Return Team”)

- Captain Mira Iwasaki (late 30s in appearance): Team lead. Scientist-soldier trained in high-latitude operations, wearing a modular exo that can switch from arctic insulation to reactive armor. From a timeline where Glennallen did hold—but at terrible cost she refuses to repeat.
- Ilya “Pasha” Orlov (40s): Heavy weapons and mech pilot. Born in Yakutsk, emigrated to Alaska as a kid. Dry humor, too many scars, runs point in anything that requires drawing fire. His suit carries a gauss-accelerator that runs hot in cold air.
- Leilani “Koa” Liko (20s): Systems engineer and medic. Their mech is thinner, built for repair, sensors, and medical loadout. The one who can jury-rig a cold-start on a 60-year-old diesel heater with a 22nd-century field battery and a prayer.
- Toma Ashby (teens): The anomaly—young but critical. Chrono-locked to Glennallen’s future in ways that make the team protective and evasive. Toma wears a micro-exo and carries the time beacon that keeps the mission anchored.

Antagonists

- The aliens (the “Vyr”): They don’t care about cities as emblems, they care about nodes: thermal signatures, power corridors, radio traffic, metal flow. Their scouts are silent and precise. Their drones smell heat and vibration; their larger “learners” shift tactics, mimicking a colony of invasive insects that got a physics degree.
- Human opportunists: A Valdez remnant—ex-contractor types who looted the port and refineries after the alien strikes and now run a convoy-heavy racket up the Richardson, trading fuel for leverage and threatening violence when refused.
- The cold and dark: Not a metaphor. Glennallen’s winters can kill; the thaw can strand. The land punishes noisy amateurs. The aliens are designed to win in urban choke points; the interior is a different game—if the locals can force it.

## Worldbuilding notes grounded in real details

- Junction town logistics: Glennallen’s position at the meeting of the Glenn and Richardson Highways is pivotal. Protagonists focus on holding road chokepoints and river bridges, with the junction as a defensible hub.
- Rivers as arteries: The Copper and Gulkana rivers define movement, food, and risk. People know where dip netters stand near Chitina, how fish wheels feed families, and which currents will eat a boat when the glacial silt rises.
- Wrangell–St. Elias proximity: The park’s Nabesna and McCarthy roads are rough access to deep backcountry the aliens don’t immediately scan as high-value; they become staging lanes and last-resort evacuation corridors.
- Utilities and permafrost: CVEA’s grid footprints matter: what can be restored silently with local gen-sets, what draws a thermal target. Permafrost, high water tables, and fragile culverts dictate where to dig and where to float.
- Aviation: Gulkana Airport’s open approaches and hard surface make it viable for short-haul freight and medevac if the runway can be kept clear and lights replaced. Turf strips freeze into assets in winter, mud in shoulder seasons.
- Health and law: Clinics are staffed by people who know your kids and your injuries. The Trooper post can coordinate as a default emergency ops center. Local radio, whether KCAM or another site, becomes the emergency net.

## Structure for a 60K thriller (high-level beats)

Target shape: 3 acts, 8–10 sequences.

### Act I: The long day

1. Opening image and tone: A single trooper cruiser sits silent on the Richardson shoulder under a sky red from far-off burning cities. Lena and Cole listen to a battery radio that skates between NOAA weather and a voice praying in Ahtna. The air tastes like ash. Glennallen’s gas station generators hum a ragged chorus. The Wrangells glow ghost-blue.

2. Community triage: The locals assess what’s left after Anchorage and bases are hit. Refugees trickle in from the Glenn; roads north report spooked wildlife and empty rest stops. The clinics triage frostbite from a failed night, not blast injuries. Elder Marie convenes a meeting at the school gym: water, heat, food. Ava scouts a weather window to find missing hunters on the Denali Highway side.

3. The first strange thing: On a moonless night, something with a mosquito’s hunger but a drone’s math paces the Gulkana Bridge. Nate and Lena go quiet, lights off, truck rolled back by hand. The thing moves on; it wasn’t here for them—it was mapping load, sound, vibration. Elder Marie says, “They haven’t learned the river.”

4. Arrival of the Return Team: A geometry comes apart near the junction in a soundless shimmer. A quartet of humans in cold-climate exos drop into the muskeg, throwing off steam in –10°F. They call Lena by name. Captain Mira says they’re from 40 years ahead. They know what’s coming. They’ve come to change a handful of moments. This is one of them.

5. The rulebook: Mira’s team draws a line: they can’t say everything. They can’t upend the web of choices that leads to survival. Their mech suits stand out, so they’ll appear only at inflection points. They want Glennallen to keep power off unless under cover. Cole bristles. Elder Marie listens. Nate asks for proof. They give him a frequency: tune the AM radio on a dusk skip, and you’ll hear tomorrow’s weather because of how the beacon bends time.

6. Inciting attack (small scale): A Vyr scout drops on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline right-of-way north of town, tasting heat in the ground from a thumper test. Mira’s people and Nate’s team move with no headlights, over the old gravel. They intercept the scout in a stand of black spruce. The fight is fast and eerie; the creatures die quiet. Koa pulls Lena aside and says: if they can keep the right-of-way “cold,” the aliens will favor the coast and Anchorage corridor. Valdez will be in play. Glennallen will not—yet.

### Act II: Alaska math

7. Training the town: Mira’s team teaches noise discipline, thermal masking, and “cold moves” Lena and Cole already respect. Elder Marie forms mutual aid lines using fishing families and trapping partners. The school gym becomes an ops center. The clinic becomes a limb of the plan: you win a siege with hygiene and shelter as much as guns.

8. Securing the field: Ava takes runs to the Gulkana Airport to check fuel and lights. She lands by daylight with no lights, towing a sledge of batteries salvaged from a defunct camp. Cole and his linemen rebuild silent heat in elders’ homes with scavenged oil stoves and improvised flues. They avoid big generator footprints. The Return Team stresses: power creates targets as surely as radios do.

9. The Valdez clutch: A convoy from the south arrives—ex-contractors with aggressive geometry welded to their pickups. They offer diesel, demand land, posture with beat-up ARs and a drone. Nate meets them at the junction with a handful of hunters. Elder Marie stands on the hood and says, “Not here.” Mira doesn’t appear. Time says: this one is your fight. The town’s first human standoff ends with the raiders backing off, humiliated, but alive. Seeds of revenge planted.

10. The midpoint revelation: Toma goes missing. Lena finds them at the Wrangell–St. Elias visitor center overlook, shaking. Toma admits the purpose: to anchor a beacon at the junction at a precise moment that will pull allied reinforcements through. In the original timeline, Glennallen’s silence made Valdez fall harder, drawing the Vyr inland via the Richardson much later. Too late for Anchorage, too late for the Interior. The Return Team wants to shift the wave: keep Glennallen low, hold the pipeline corridor cold, force the aliens to commit heavy assets down the coast where a trap will be sprung. Someone has to be bait. Valdez will burn again. Lena asks, “Did we choose that?” Mira says, “You did. We did.” A chasm opens.

11. Sabotage: That night, a transformer explodes off the Richardson—no alien, but a human hand. The Valdez convoy slipped back, angry and patient, and now they’re testing Glennallen’s fault lines. Cole knows the substation and moves to cut the fire. Koa and Mira slip west to the lines with a “coolnet”—a thermal mesh the Return Team can drape over hot metal. The town wakes to an aurora blazing overhead and the smell of ozone. Any alien drone riding the aurora will see heat on the ground. A risky fix works; the glow fades. Elder Marie whispers a name of someone’s cousin in Valdez and tells Lena what will need to happen if people from the port show again.

12. First probe: The Vyr learn the bridge. They send a larger “learner” to the Gulkana crossing with flexible legs that taste wind and load. Nate and Lena set charges on an old logging spur, not the bridge. When the “learner” steps off the planked shoulder to test a snowmobile track, it falls through into a creek that isn’t frozen all the way to bottom. Cold bites alien faster than human. Pasha’s mech finishes the job under a blanket of brush that keeps the muzzle’s heat signature thin. The town breathes. The Return Team’s suits crackle with frost.

13. Morale and drift: Cabin fever meets war fatigue. Ava’s Cessna gets a bullet hole—from a jumpy local kid, not a raider. A baby is born in the clinic; a widow refuses to leave her drafty house; someone steals antibiotics. Mira goes hardline: these frays are ponies the Vyr ride. Lena counters: people are not math. The argument is real. They compromise: more hands on night watch, more elders in the school, more caches off the main grid.

14. The betrayal: The Valdez crew returns with white flags and an envoy who grew up in Glennallen and went south for pipeline work. He offers gear, maps, and claims they were wrong. Lena distrusts, Elder Marie listens, and Mira sticks to rules: we don’t preempt human betrayal because it may anchor a different alliance later. The envoy eats stew, scouts the gym, and slips coordinates to someone else after dark. The Return Team intercepts the whisper on a passive microphone and chooses—painfully—not to roll up the network yet.

### Act III: The junction burns, but not like this

15. The pincer: The Vyr learner arrays come inland from two vectors—one sniffing through the Copper River side, one ghosting northward up the Richardson. Simultaneously, a small human force hits the Gulkana runway to grab fuel and deny Glennallen its fixed-wing lifeline. The aliens are not driving for the junction—they’re testing. The humans are. The town can’t fight both head-on.

16. The time anchor: Toma moves to the exact spot near the highways where a time geometry stays stable. Cole and Ava deliver a silent genny, Koa assembles a payload, and Elder Marie kneels to tell a story while they wait—how winter humbles the hungry. The beacon spins a skein of cold light that smells like ozone and cedar. Far away, under some other aurora, someone answers.

17. The runway fight: Nate, Pasha, Lena, and a squad of trappers and pilots hold the airport. It’s not a banner fight. It’s shotguns at 25 yards in blowing snow, it’s flares used as deception, it’s a bear banger that sends a human attacker stumbling. Pasha takes a round; his suit groans. The raiders are tough and not cowards. When they break, they torch a fuel bladder. Ava and Cole bulldoze snow into a berm to smother part of the fire. The rest must be let to burn: too hot to hide. The aurora above gets brighter as if mocking them.

18. The bridge trick, one more time: The “learner” finds the Gulkana Bridge again. This time, instead of stepping onto soft ground, it tests the concrete abutments. It begins to pour something that crystallizes steel. Mira had predicted new tricks. She counters with a cryofoam that calcifies alien with the spring run-off’s sharp water, turns it into a brittle statue. The statue breaks into the current and vanishes. The Return Team’s tech is not magic; it’s chemistry and cold.

19. The Glennallen line: The Valdez raiders make their play on the junction itself—white lights on trucks, diesel roaring, loud as anger. Elder Marie walks into the road. Behind her, mothers and teenagers, and old men in Carhartt jackets, and “Skiff” standing on a wing with a shotgun. Nate steps forward. He offers: come eat. Help hold the line against the thing that eats both of us. The envoy wavers. The original raider leader tells a crude joke. And then a Vyr drone glides over, drawn by the noise and the heat of anger. It hovers, tasting surprise.

20. The fused climax: Human guns drop. The drone almost doesn’t move. Then something else arrives: a second shimmer—like the one that brought Mira—and a one-time dump of friends from the future: a handful of exos, a sleigh of supplies, and a voice on the radio that sounds like Lena forty years older. Everyone understands at once: this town held. This is the fulcrum. The raider leader shoots at the shimmer; the drone reacts. It takes him first. The envoy, in tears, shouts to his men to stand down. Pasha laughs and coughs blood; Mira stares at the drone as it learns to avoid cryofoam.

21. Resolution at the junction: The drone is cut apart by three quiet maneuvers the town will later tell different ways—Nate’s truck lured it onto ice, Koa’s magnet pad locked its sensor briefly, Elder Marie blew a horn that echoed oddly and confused it. Likely, all are true in parts. The enemy falls. The beacon locks. The Return Team’s timeline changes.

## Epilogue beats

- Toma at the visitor center reading the names of mountains one more time while the sun rolls like a coin along their rims.
- Ava flying at dusk over the Gulkana, seeing ice plates tilt and align in new seams, imagining using them as roads.
- Cole staring at a substation, his hand on metal that hums in a new way, and deciding they will energize for exactly three hours a day and no more. Quiet when dark. Loud when necessary.
- Elder Marie teaching teenagers to sing certain songs on certain bends of the Copper River because sound travels downriver in a way machines don’t hear.
- Mira looking south along the Richardson and knowing what must be baited at Valdez—again—and just how they’ll do it differently.

## Character arcs and relationships

- Lena → leadership through stubborn grace: She begins as the organizer of food and heat, becomes the operative pivot for town-wide defense, and ends ready to go south to Valdez or east to Tok to widen the fight—if the town can spare her. Her relationship with Toma (part older sister, part future self) grounds the time-ethics in a human bond.
- Cole → redemption and calculated risk: Haunted by a preventable death, he relearns that sometimes you do have to break safety to save many. He crafts a new grid doctrine: micro-heating, no big generators, lots of storage heat, stealthy repair. His grudging respect for Mira becomes mutual.
- Ava → courage with purpose: Her daredevil flying shifts to a discipline that looks like restraint. She becomes the bridge to other hubs—Paxson, Chitina, and eventually McCarthy.
- Nate → law as covenant: He learns when to let community justice speak and when to force a standard. He builds a loose coalition including parts of the Valdez crew—reformed by sight of the drone and the shimmer.
- Elder Marie → the center: She makes the calls no one else can: which path to McCarthy stays open for elders, who gets the scarce antibiotics, when to risk singing.

The Return Team:

- Mira → the burden of knowledge: She breaks one of her own rules late in the novel to save a child—knowing it could weaken their beacon. It doesn’t, and she learns something about this timeline: it has different seams of resilience.
- Pasha → the cost: He bleeds but lives, scarred deeper. He will be a mentor for new fighters in Book 2.
- Koa → the bridge: They find that half the time the 22nd-century field kit is less useful than an old drip stove and a spruce log. They learn the songs Elder Marie teaches and hum them at night while soldering.
- Toma → the anchor: They see a future that is changing and are terrified by who they might become. They end with a secret from the future that could fracture the group, and a choice not to tell yet.

## The aliens (“Vyr”) and technology

- Behavior: They prioritize heat and power corridors—pipeline, substations, high-traffic road junctions. Early on, they are blind to how rivers and winds mislead thermal signatures in the interior. They learn. They adapt. They send “learners” with modular limbs and colder cores to survive immersion. They don’t care about capturing humans for study; they care about optimizing suppression.
- Weaknesses: Noise discipline and heat masking frustrate them. Rivers and lakes that don’t freeze to the bottom kill their scouts. Cold chemistry (fast cryo foams), vibration traps in muskeg, and acoustic confusion in coulees work until the next iteration. They advance along coasts smoothly but stumble inland where local knowledge outplays maps.

Future tech and rules:

- The Return Team’s suits aren’t invincible; they trade sustained firepower for arctic survivability. Batteries hate cold. Armor grows brittle. Repair is constant.
- The time beacon can only hold an anchor at a place of recurring human attention (junction, overlook, bridge). It smells like ozone on aurora nights and calls aid exactly once per location, unless kept powered by a low, steady hum that looks like a utility ground. Cole improvises that hum.
- The Prime Constraints: The team can’t preempt certain human choices; they must allow some betrayals and pain to occur because later alliances depend on them. They can’t dump future schematics. They can bend chemistry and tactics; they can’t rewrite the town.

## Sequel seeds and broader Alaska canvas

- South to Valdez (Book 2): Stage a trap at the Alyeska Marine Terminal and the avalanche-laced Thompson Pass corridor. The Vyr like to occupy infrastructure; make Valdez into a lure and counterstrike. The Valdez crew that bent at the junction becomes junior allies on home turf. The port’s geography (steep-walled canyon, oil storage farms, bridges) offers cinematic choke points and moral hazard.
- North to Delta/Fairbanks (Book 3): Salvage at Eielson AFB and Fort Wainwright. Rebuild a corridor of communities along the Richardson and the Alaska Highway. If the Vyr learn to love the pipeline, make it their undoing. Introduce Interior allies with different strategies and politics.
- East to Tok and across the border (Book 4): Expand coalition across the Yukon, navigating border laws that no longer matter much and relationships that matter more. Develop a continental resistance with shared cold-country doctrine.
- Deep into Wrangell–St. Elias (Interludes/Novellas): Use Nabesna and McCarthy as staging, with old Kennecott copper works turned into shielded shelters. Glaciers move; time moves; let the Return Team’s anchor sites align with old mining scars that confuse Vyr sensors.

Meta-arc threads:

- The Vyr’s real target might be a geo-energetic feature under Alaska’s chained mountain terranes; they read plate margins like lines on a map. Wrangell’s volcanism and the coast’s subduction zone hum to them.
- The Return Team’s origin shifts as the timeline does. Mira occasionally glitches—memories that no longer happened for her. Toma’s anchor changes, too. In Book 3, a copy of Toma who made a different choice might appear briefly at the wrong place.
- What really happened in Anchorage the night the bases went dark? A handful survived in tunnels beneath the airfield. They will matter.

## Sensory and cultural texture

- Sound: The quiet of snow that kills signals; the pop of ice shifting under a loaded truck; the hiss of an oil stove; the click of a scanner searching for a voice.
- Smell: Ozone, diesel, spruce pitch, wet wool, glacial silt, and the iron tang of cold air in your teeth.
- Light: Long gloaming; aurora that feels like a curtain between times; the flat pewter light of thaw, the blinding spark of winter sun on wind-polished snow.
- Culture: Ahtna family networks and protocols of respect; tide-like oscillations between independence and collaboration; the pull of salmon, the ritual of caribou season, the voice of a trooper on the radio saying, “Be safe out there,” as both order and blessing.

## Accuracy notes and how they inform scenes

- Geography and roads: Glennallen lies at the Glenn/Richardson junction, making the school gym and nearby lots natural staging grounds. Scenes use real vectors: south to Valdez (Thompson Pass), north to Delta (Isabel Pass and beyond), east to Tok Cut-Off, west to Anchorage via Glenn Highway and Eureka Summit.
- Rivers: The Gulkana Bridge sequence leverages a real crossing and the river’s mix of frozen runs and undermined ice. The Copper’s braided delta and fierce current inform what cannot be crossed and when.
- Climate: Discipline with heat, light, and sound are survival tactics in subarctic winter. The Return Team’s insistence on “no big generators” comes from heat signature realities. Mosquitoes and boggy summer ground tilt the balance in a different season—foreshadowed for later books.
- Utilities: The narrative uses the reality that electrification in rural Alaska is cooperative and distributed; silent, small-scale heat and power are credible in Glennallen and align with stealth needs.
- Aviation: The Gulkana Airport is a lifeline and target. Scenes depict daylight-only ops without runway lights until locals rig improvised low-signature markers.

## Back-cover style promise for Book 1

When the sky over Anchorage burns and the radios go to prayer, Glennallen refuses to scatter. With winter settling and enemies learning the roads, a strike team from the future steps through the aurora to say: you matter. Hold this place. Keep the pipeline corridor cold. Change what comes. But time is stingy. The Return Team won’t reveal everything, and their suits can’t beat the cold. As alien scouts probe bridges and raiders roll up the Richardson, the town must decide whether to stay dark and small—or light a beacon that draws both allies and monsters.

In the Copper River Valley, everybody knows the river writes its own history. This time, with the junction on the line and a future at stake, Glennallen will write back.

## Outline summary (for your 60K novel build)

- 10–12 chapter beats, 1–3 scenes each. Strong POV focus on Lena (60%), with interleaved chapters from Mira, Nate, and Ava.
- Act I (~20K): World falls, town triages, Return Team arrives, localized clash at pipeline ROW.
- Act II (~25K): Training, convoy standoff, midpoint revelation about Valdez and beacon, sabotage, learner probe countered.
- Act III (~15K): Twin assault (Gulkana runway and bridge), beacon lock at junction, fused climax with raiders, Vyr drone, and reinforcements, resolution and setup for Valdez arc.

## End-state that tees up Book 2

- Glennallen remains intact and low-profile, with a compact, cold-operating doctrine. The junction is held by coalition that now includes repentant Valdez drivers.
- The beacon is anchored; a one-time reinforcement has arrived, but future shimmers are limited and must be earned by holding specific nodes.
- Valdez is next. The trap can be set in the canyons and tanks, with Glennallen as the inland logistics brain. Ava, Cole, Mira, and Lena will go; Nate will remain as spine of the junction; Elder Marie’s voice becomes the series’ conscience.
