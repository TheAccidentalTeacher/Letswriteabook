# QA Final Report

_Last Updated: 2025-10-10_<br>
_Owner: QA Lead_

## Scope
Summarize the outcomes of Phase 9 testing efforts, including automation coverage, manual exploration, and compatibility findings versus the legacy system.

## Current Status

- Guardrail load scenarios (connection quota, origin quota, subscription cap, idle eviction) completed 2025-10-06 with artifacts in `docs/qa/load-test-reports/2025-10-06/`.
- Staging catch-up and broadcast burst runs scheduled for 2025-10-10; results will extend the load-test folder and feed latency baselines.
- QA Test Roadmap (`docs/qa/test-roadmap.md`) now tracks near-term owners, target dates, and evidence for all remaining validation work.

## Key Sections
- Test matrix results (unit, integration, contract, E2E, load) with links to supporting artifacts.
- Defect summary and remediation status, cross-referenced with GitHub issues.
- Performance regression analysis relative to baseline metrics (latency, replay duration, resource utilisation).
- Release readiness recommendation and outstanding risks, including go/no-go gating criteria.
- Appendix summarising roadmap commitments pulled from `docs/qa/test-roadmap.md` at sign-off time.

Prepare this document for executive sign-off prior to Phase 10 deployment. Update the status table after each milestone review so leadership can track QA burn-down alongside the roadmap.
