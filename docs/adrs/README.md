# Architecture Decision Records

Maintain one ADR per significant technical choice following [Michael Nygard's template](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Index

- [ADR-0001: Monorepo Tooling Baseline](ADR-0001-monorepo-tooling-baseline.md)

## Filing Guidelines

- **Status**: Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated.
- **Location**: `ADR-XXXX-title.md` using a sequential 4-digit identifier.
- **Scope**: Record alternatives considered, decision outcome, and consequences.
- **Linkage**: Reference related tickets, RFCs, and impacted phases from the rebuild plan.

Create new ADRs with the helper script once tooling is in place (see Phase 2 of the execution plan).
